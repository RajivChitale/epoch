### Dynamic Programming
Breakdown a problem into subproblems. Reuse calculations for subproblems by storing their solutions in a table. Following properties must hold:  
- Optimal Substructure: optimal solution can be found using optimal solutions to subproblems.
- Overlapping Subproblems: subproblems have repeated calculations. 

Used in RL methods such as value iteration, policy iteration.
