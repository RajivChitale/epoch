### Monte Carlo Methods
- Monte Carlo Methods only need experience to learn. This includes states traversed and rewards collected in an episode. 
- Experience can be generated by simulating random actions. 
- These methods are model free. No knowledge of transisions required.
- Values of states are calculated independent of others (no bootstrapping).
